"""All the Shader Graph materials in this scene use the <b>Stacklist Master Stack</b> Shader.

The StackLit Master Stack can render materials that are more complex than the Lit Master Stack. It includes all the features available in the Lit shader and, sometimes, provides more advanced or higher quality versions. For example, it uses a more advanced form of specular occlusion and also calculates anisotropic reflections for area lights in the same way the Lit shader does for other light types. It also takes into account light interactions between two vertically stacked physical layers, along with a more complex looking general base layer.
     
The <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.high-definition@latest/index.html?subfolder=/manual/stacklit-material.html">Stacklit material</a> allows you to stack multiple material core feature like : Anisotropy, Coat and Coat Normal, Dual Specular Lobe, Translucent, Iridescence, Subsurface Scaterring and Transmission. 

This scene only focuses on some example materials that needs multiple material core features to be rendered accurately.""",
