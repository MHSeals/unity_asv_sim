    description: 'The Silk shader is your starting point for rendering anisotropic
      fabrics in the High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP). You can use the Silk
      shader to create fabrics like silk, satin, nylon, and polyester.


      Silk
      and other synthetic fibers are usually smoother than natural fibres because
      they''re produced as a single smooth filament. When these fibres are woven
      together, it produces a fabric with anisotropic specular highlights.
