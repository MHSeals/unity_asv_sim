    description: 'The StackLit Master Stack can render materials that are more complex
      than the Lit Master Stack. It includes all the features available in the Lit
      shader and, sometimes, provides more advanced or higher quality versions. All
      of those features can be stacked together on the same shader.


      This
      is a template for creating a Car Paint material using a <b>Dual Specular Lobe</b>,
      allowing two specular highlights to simulate hazy materials on the flaky base
      layer. On top of that, it also uses <b>Coating</b> to have one more layer of
      smooth specular reflection.
