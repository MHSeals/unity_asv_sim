    description: 'The Cotton/Wool shader is your starting point for rendering diffuse
      fabrics in the High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP). You can use the Cotton/Wool
      shader to create fabrics like cotton, wool, linen, or velvet.


      The type
      of fibers that make up the fabric, as well as the fabric''s knit or weave,
      influence the appearance of the fabric. Natural fibers are typically rougher
      so they diffuse light.
