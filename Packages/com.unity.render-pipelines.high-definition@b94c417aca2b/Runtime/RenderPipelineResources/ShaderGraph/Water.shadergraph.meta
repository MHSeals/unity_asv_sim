    description: "Use the Water Master Stack to render custom physically based water
      Material in the High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP). The Water Master Stack
      approximately models a volumetric water medium, and includes properties to
      render effects such as caustics, scattering, and refraction.\r\n\r\nThis is
      the template used for the default Water Surface in HDRP. This material is to
      be used exclusively as a custom material using HDRP <b>Water System</b>, not
      on custom geometry. \r\nUse it as a starting point to create your own modifications
      such as: adding custom foam, altering caustics, etc.\r\n\r\n<i>Supported Pipeline(s):
      HDRP\r\nActive Target: Water\r\nVFX Graph Support: disabled</i>"
