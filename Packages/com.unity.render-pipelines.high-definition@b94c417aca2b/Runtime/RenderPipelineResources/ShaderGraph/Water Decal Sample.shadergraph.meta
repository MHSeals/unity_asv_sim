    category: Environment and Materials
    description: "To create foam, deformation, or water currents, you can use a water
      decal. Water decals add localized water effects to a specific region in a 3D
      scene. This region is anchored in world space to a GameObject transform or,
      by default, to the camera. Use water decals to easily replicate effects across
      multiple regions, such as around islands or shorelines, without re-authoring
      textures.\r\n\r\nThis is a simple template allowing you to alter the water
      surface with predefined shapes. \r\nThis Water Decal contains Box, Bow Wave,
      Shore Waves and Texture shape already setup with deformation, surface foam
      and deep foam. \r\n\r\n<i>Supported Pipeline(s): HDRP\r\nActive Target: Water
      Decal\r\nVFX Graph Support: disabled</i>"
