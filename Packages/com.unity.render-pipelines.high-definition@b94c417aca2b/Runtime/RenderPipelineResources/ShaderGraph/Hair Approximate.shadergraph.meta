    description: "You can use the Hair template as a starting point for rendering
      hair and fur in the High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP). To create a realistic
      looking hair effect, the Hair Shader Graph uses layers called hair cards. Each
      hair card represents a different section of hair. If you use semi-transparent
      hair cards, you must manually sort them so that they're in back-to-front order
      from every viewing direction.\r\n\r\nThe Approximate Material Type mimics the
      characteristics of human hair. It is based on the Kajiya-Kay hair shading model.
      This model doesn\u2019t automatically look realistic in every lighting setup.
      This means you need to adjust the blocks in the Fragment context to suit the
      lighting environment in your scene. It is best for darker hair tones. \r\n\r\n<i>Supported
