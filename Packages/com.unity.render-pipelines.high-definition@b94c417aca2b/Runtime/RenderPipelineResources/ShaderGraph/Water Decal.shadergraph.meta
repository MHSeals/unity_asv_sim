    name: Water Decal Simple
    category: Environment and Materials
    description: "To create foam, deformation, or water currents, you can use a water
      decal. Water decals add localized water effects to a specific region in a 3D
      scene. This region is anchored in world space to a GameObject transform or,
      by default, to the camera. Use water decals to easily replicate effects across
      multiple regions, such as around islands or shorelines, without re-authoring
      textures.\r\n\r\nThis is a simple template for adding deformation, surface
      foam and deep foam to a </b>Water Surface</b>. \r\n\r\n<i>Supported Pipeline(s):
      HDRP\r\nActive Target: Water Decal\r\nVFX Graph Support: disabled</i>"
