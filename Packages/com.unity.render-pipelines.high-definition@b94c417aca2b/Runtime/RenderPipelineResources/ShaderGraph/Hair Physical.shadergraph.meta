    description: 'You can use the Hair template as a starting point for rendering
      hair and fur in the High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP). The hair shaders
      also work with the <b>High Quality Line Renderer</b>, which is a line segment
      software rasterizer designed for fast, high quality transparency and anti-aliasing.


      The
      Physical Material Type automatically creates physically correct results in
      any light environment. It accurately accounts for the amount of incident light
      to scatter within a hair fiber (known as an energy-conserving hair model).
      This means the Physical model works correctly in any lighting environment.
