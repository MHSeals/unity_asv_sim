    description: "The <b>Physically Based Sky</b> simulates a spherical planet with
      a two-part atmosphere that has an exponentially decreasing density based on
      its altitude. This means that the higher you go above sea level, the less dense
      the atmosphere is. Additionally, the model includes an ozone layer following
      a tent distribution based on altitude.\r\n\r\nThis is a template for customizing
      sky with stars, nebula, ground textures and more complex effect like aurora
      borealis.\r\nYou can then assign this material in the material rendering mode
      field in the Physically Base Sky override. \r\n\r\n<i>Supported Pipeline(s):
      HDRP\r\nActive Target: Physically Based Sky\r\nVFX Graph Support: disabled</i>"
