    description: 'Creates a Shader Graph asset that behaves the same as the HDRP
      Lit shader that is written in code. This can be used as a replacement for the
      code version and is a good stating place if you want to alter the Lit shader''s
      features.


      This template uses the same Custom Editor GUI as HDRP''s
      Lit shader. This means that the material GUI is dependent on the specific set
      of parameters it''s using. If you''re planning to remove or change parameters
      in the Blackboard, you may want to also remove the reference to the Custom
      Editor GUI so that parameters will appear and work as intended.
