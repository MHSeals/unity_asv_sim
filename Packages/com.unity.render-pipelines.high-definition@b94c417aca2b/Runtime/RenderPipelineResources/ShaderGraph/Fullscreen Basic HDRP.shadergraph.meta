      adjustments including tinting, saturation, and contrast.\r\n\r\nFullscreen
      shaders are intended to be used to apply image adjustments for applications
      like post-process filters. They are not intended to be applied to individual
      meshes.\r\n\r\nTo apply a fullscreen shader as a post-process filter, create
      a Custom Pass Volume, add a Fullscreen Custom Pass and assign a material created
      from your fullscreen shader.\r\n\r\n<i>Supported Pipeline(s): HDRP\r\nActive
